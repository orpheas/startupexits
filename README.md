# Predicting Startup Exits Using Crunchbase Data - A Venture Capitalist Perspective

## Abstract

Startups are cornerstones of advanced economies, but they fail at a high rate. Venture
Capitalists are responsible for sourcing promising startups, investing capital and value-added
services to help them grow, with the end-goal of achieving a return on
their investment. When investing in startups, VCs declare that some of the most significant
factors that play a role in their decision-making are the founding team, the business
model, the industry, and more. Utilizing data from Crunchbase, one of the largest
platforms in the world for startup, funding, acquisition, and IPO data, we attempt to
employ the decision-making factors of VCs in the production of machine learning models
that will predict which startups will reach acquisition or IPO stages, thus generating a
return for their venture investors. Our analysis formally adopts the CRISP-DM methodology
and employs Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine algorithms in producing the
predictive models. Logistic Regression turned out to be our better performing model with
an F1 score of 61.69%, a Precision score of 63.07%, and TPR/FPR rates of 70.10%/57.55%.
With the model carrying promise for identifying investment-worthy startups, further
iterations have been recommended in order to produce a better and more robust model.
